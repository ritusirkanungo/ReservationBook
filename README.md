# ReservationBook
The goal of the final project is to demonstrate your knowledge of Open Source tools. It is a full featured webbased application, particularly one that implements something akin to Open Table , where instead of just having restaurants, users can add any "resource"
that is reservable (e.g. classroom, library book, car share, video game, etc):
● Written in Python and deployed with either App Engine.
● Developed using GIT , with regular code commits.
● Stored data in Google App Engine's data store.
● Rendered HTML with templates , preferably Jinja2.
